## Project Overview
This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and a CSV dataset (`.csv`) to analyze and visualize data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and possibly model training or other analytical processes.

## Files Description
- **Notebook (`.ipynb`)**: Contains Python code to process and analyze the dataset, along with markdown cells explaining each step.
- **Dataset (`.csv`)**: A structured file containing raw data used for analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (if applicable)

You can install missing libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook filename.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.
3. Inspect outputs such as data visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Dataset Information
- The CSV file contains structured data with various attributes.
- Ensure the file is in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## Output
The notebook generates:
- Data visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps, etc.).
- Processed datasets (if applicable).
- Statistical insights derived from the dataset.

## Contributions
Feel free to modify and improve the notebook. If you find any issues, report them or submit enhancements.
